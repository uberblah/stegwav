an audio steganography program, with a single .c/.h LSB steganography lib

the software requires libsndfile and its headers

it should support the same formats as libsndfile,
  but has only been tested with .wav files

note that the output format may have extended values
  to make more space for the steganographed data

the encoder is in ensteg.c
the decoder is in desteg.c
the LSB steganography library is in steg.{c,h}

to run a test, place a WAV file called input.wav in this directory,
  and run test.sh...
